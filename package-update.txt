To complete the implementation of the notification system, you'll need to:

1. Install the react-hot-toast package:
```
npm install react-hot-toast
```

2. Run the SQL script to create the notification tables:
- Open the Supabase dashboard
- Go to the SQL Editor
- Copy and paste the content from notification_system.sql
- Run the script

3. Test the notification system:
- Send a message in the global chat
- Send a direct message to a friend
- Create a group chat and send a message
- Verify that notifications appear correctly

The implementation includes:
- Database tables for tracking message status
- A trigger function to handle new messages
- A React context provider for notifications
- Integration with the existing UI

This provides a solid foundation for the three-layer notification system:
- Layer 1: In-app toasts and badges (implemented)
- Layer 2: Push notifications (ready for implementation)
- Layer 3: Email digests (ready for implementation)

You can extend this system in the future to add push notifications and email digests as described in the design.
